# Project Setup and Infrastructure Guide

## Prerequisites
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 16 or higher recommended).
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerization.
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.

## Project Setup

    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure environment variables:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add the required variables as specified in `.env.example`.

## Infrastructure Setup
1. Start Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

2. Verify services are running:
    - Check logs using `docker-compose logs`.
    - Ensure database and other services are accessible.

## Running the Application
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Testing
1. Run unit tests:
    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

2. Run integration tests:
    ```bash
    npm run test:integration
    ```

## Deployment
1. Build the application:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Deploy using your preferred method (e.g., Docker, cloud provider).
